# BizMetrics.io API NodeJS client
BizMetrics.io REST API - NodeJS library 

Currently, this is the generated code using [Swagger](https://github.com/swagger-api/) on its 1.2 version. It is not guaranteed to work, but it should provide a good starting point to use BizMetrics's API.

Contributions and improvements are welcomed and encouraged.
